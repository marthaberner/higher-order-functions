/*

Define a function named "eachy" that takes:

- an argument named `list` which is an array
- an argument named `callback` which is a function

Inside `eachy`, set up a for loop that goes over the array.  Inside the for loop, call `callback` and pass it both:

- the item from the array
- the counter (probably `i`)

Execute `eachy` passing it an anonymous function that console logs the arguments.

Execute `eachy` passing it a variable that points to function that console logs the arguments.
