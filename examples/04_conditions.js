/*

Define a function named "maybeMaybe" that takes:

- an argument named `doIt` which is expected to be a boolean
- an argument named `onSuccess` which is a function
- an argument named `onFailure` which is a function

Inside `maybeMaybe`, set up a conditional.  If `doIt` is truthy, execute `onSuccess`.  Otherwise execute `onFailure`.

Execute `maybeMaybe` passing it two anonymous functions that log something.

Execute `maybeMaybe` passing it two variables that point to functions that log something.

Execute `maybeMaybe` passing it one anonymous function, and one variable that points to a function that log something.
